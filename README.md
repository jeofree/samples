# Jeffrey Burr Work Examples

This portfolio contains a sampling of documentation, user interfaces, and graphics that I've created for clients and employers.



## API Documentation

Expertise with OpenAPI 3.0, Swagger 2.0 (and the difference between them).

A recent documentation sample from my current work:

## Pinterest Developer New Hire Guide

I created this in Confluence. This is a PDF export of one part of a topic, with a few details redacted.

## Infocenters

This represents the kind of documentation I wrote in my earliest technical writing experiences at Alcatel and IBM. This typically meant working on a team of half a dozen writers, learning how to write using DITA and various XML editors like Epic Editor, Oxygen XML, and IBM's in-house Information Developers Workbench (IDWB) which was actually the precusor to the DITA-OT.
