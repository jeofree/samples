I've created multiple API documentation portals using ReadMe.io over the past several years, some of which are showcased on ReadMe's [Customer Showcase page](https://readme.com/customers) (scroll down to "Agari").

[My most recent ReadMe.io site](https://docs.sezzle.com/sezzle-integration/docs), just launched.


## Pinterest Developer New Hire Guide

I created this in Confluence. This is a PDF export of one part of a topic, with a few details redacted.

## Infocenters

This represents the kind of documentation I wrote in my earliest technical writing experiences at Alcatel and IBM. This typically meant working on a team of half a dozen writers, learning how to write using DITA and various XML editors like Epic Editor, Oxygen XML, and IBM's in-house Information Developers Workbench (IDWB) which was actually the precusor to the DITA-OT.
