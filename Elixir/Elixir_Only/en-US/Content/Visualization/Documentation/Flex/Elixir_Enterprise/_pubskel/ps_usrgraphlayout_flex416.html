<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Organizes nodes without overlaps in
horizontal or vertical levels. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Arranges the graph such that the majority
of links are short and flow uniformly in the same direction (from
left to right, from top to bottom, and so on). </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Reduces the number of link crossings.
Most of the time, produces drawings with no crossings or only a small
number of crossings. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Often produces balanced drawings that
emphasize the symmetries in the graph. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Supports self-links (that is, links with the same origin and
destination node), multiple links between the same pair of nodes, and cycles. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Efficient, scalable algorithm. Produces
a nice layout for most sparse and medium-dense graphs relatively quickly,
even if the number of nodes is very large.  </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Provides several alignment and offset
options. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Supports port specifications where links
attach the nodes. Allows you to specify which side of a node (top,
bottom, left, right) a link can be connected to or to specify which
relative port position should be used for the connection.  </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Supports layout constraints. Allows
you to specify relative positional constraints, for instance, that
a node is above another node or left of another node. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Incremental and nonincremental mode.
In incremental mode, the previous position of nodes are taken into
account. Positions the nodes without changing the relative order of
the nodes so that the layout is stable on incremental changes of the
graph.  </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Can handle flat and nested graphs. In
recursive layout mode, it routes the intergraph links of nested graphs
and places the labels of nodes and links in subgraphs.</div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The computation time depends on the
number of nodes, the number of levels, and the number of links that
cross several levels. Most of the time, the links are placed between
adjacent levels, which keeps the computation time small.  </div>

<h2 class="heading">Limitations</h2>


<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The algorithm tries to minimize the
number of link crossings (which is generally an NP-complete problem). It is mathematically impossible
to solve this problem quickly for any graph size. Therefore, the algorithm
uses a very fast heuristic that obtains a good layout, but not always
with the theoretical minimum number of link crossings. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The algorithm tries to place the nodes
such that all links point uniformly in the same direction. It is impossible
to place cycles of links in this way. For this reason, it sometimes
produces a graph where a small number of links are reversed to point
into the opposite direction. The algorithm tries to minimize the number
of reversed links (which, again, is an NP-complete problem). Therefore,
the algorithm uses a very fast heuristic resulting in a good layout,
but not always with the theoretical minimum number of reversed links.
 </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The computation time required to obtain
an appropriate drawing depends most significantly on the number of
bends in the links. Since the algorithm places one bend whenever a
link crosses a level, the number of bends can grow relatively quickly
if the layout requires many long links that span several levels. Therefore,
the layout process may become very time-consuming for dense graphs
(the number of links is relatively high compared to the number of
nodes) or for graphs that require a large number of node levels. </div>
