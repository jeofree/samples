<h2 class="heading">Diagrams</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">Diagrams are used to show the relationships between entities
in a system. The entities are called nodes and the relationships are
called links. This type of display helps model and manage a business
system’s entities connected either physically (like in a communications
network) or logically (like in a process flowchart) . IBM® <span class="classificationVariable">Diagram</span> can be used to build computerized
displays of static as well as dynamic diagrams. A diagram can be static
in the sense that there are no changes in its appearance while it
is displayed: it is a snapshot of a given system. Typical examples
include flowcharts and organization charts.  A dynamic diagram can
react to user actions or external data feeds, or both. It remains
in contact with business data during the display phase and is expected
to change over time in response to business-related changes. Typical
examples include process flow diagrams and network monitoring diagrams. 
As diagrams grow larger and more complex, <span class="classificationVariable">Diagram</span>allows you to make them more readable
through its built-in graph layout algorithms, organizational techniques
such as subgraphs and swimlanes, helpful zooming and scrolling behavior,
and even customized interactions such as editing, drill-down, and
more.  </div>

<h2 class="heading">Dashboards</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">Dashboards are used for monitoring business or industrial
systems. They help operational people oversee the Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) of business processes. In the industrial field,
dashboards are used for schematics, process control or Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) applications to show the current
status of physical equipment. The data to be monitored is graphically
represented by gauges, dials, sliders, meters, and so on, that are
manually placed by the user on the dashboard. A connection between
the data repository and these graphic objects is required for the
dashboard to visually and realistically translate measurements or
the status of physical equipment. You can use IBM® <span class="classificationVariable">ILOG Elixir</span> components to create the contents of the dashboards you are creating
as shown in the following examples.</div>

<h2 class="heading">Map-based displays</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">Map-based displays are used to represent and manage georeferenced
assets in applications such as logistics, defense, traffic monitoring,
or network systems. Objects are placed on top of a map according to
their latitude and longitude coordinates; in a dynamic application,
the geographic positions of the objects are updated as the values
of the underlying data change.</div>
