<div class="descriptiveTopicContent">
<div class="para">A set of constraints may cause conflicts. This means
that not all of the constraints can be satisfied at the same time.
For instance, it is impossible to force two nodes into the same level
by an <code class="code">IlvSameLevelConstraint</code> while at the
same time forcing one of the nodes to a higher level than the other
node by an <code class="code">IlvRelativeLevelConstraint</code>.
In this case, one of the two constraints must be ignored during layout. </div>
<div class="para">In general, constraint conflicts are resolved by ignoring
the constraints with the lowest priority while the constraints with
the highest priority get satisfied. The following rules explain the
constraint priorities in detail. </div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The constraints that influence into
which level a node is placed are applied before the constraints that
influence the position of the node within a level. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvExtremityConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvExtremityConstraint</a></span> is translated into a sequence of constraints with
high priority. For instance, the extremity constraint with the south
side is translated into several same level constraints and several
relative level constraints. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvSameLevelConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvSameLevelConstraint</a></span> and the  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvGroupSpreadConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvGroupSpreadConstraint</a></span> have the highest priority. They are never in conflict
with each other. They dominate all other constraints, even the specified
level index. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvLevelRangeConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvLevelRangeConstraint</a></span> (and the direct level index specification) has the
second highest priority. If two nodes are forced to the same level
but have disjoint specified level ranges, then the level range is
ignored. In the following example: </div>
<pre class="programlisting">
layout.addConstraint(new IlvSameLevelConstraint(node1, node2));
layout.setSpecNodeLevelIndex(node1, 5);
layout.setSpecNodeLevelIndex(node2, 10);
</pre>
<div class="para">both <code class="code">node1</code> and <code class="code">node2</code> will be placed at level 5. The conflicting specification:
layout.setSpecNodeLevelIndex(node2, 10) is ignored. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvRelativeLevelConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvRelativeLevelConstraint</a></span> is dominated by the same level constraint, by the
level range constraint, and by the direct specification of level indices.
If several relative level constraints conflict each other, the one
with the highest specified priority dominates. However, note that
all links are implicitly considered relative level constraints as
well. If links with high priority force a node to a certain level,
then a relative level constraint with lower priority will be ignored. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvSwimLaneConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvSwimLaneConstraint</a></span> is always evaluated, even if the incremental mode
is enabled. The constraint has a higher priority than the relative
position constraint and the side-by-side constraint. You can specify
side-by-side constraints for a group of nodes that belong to the same
swim lane, but side-by-side constraints of nodes of different swim
lanes are ignored. You can specify relative position constraints between
nodes of the same swim lane. You can also specify relative position
constraints between one entire swim lane group and another swim lane
group, which effectively orders the swim lanes. But relative position
constraints are ignored if they would require breaking the swim lanes
apart. The swim lane constraint dominates the specified position indices
and the extremity constraints, that is, if a swim lane constraint
is used, you cannot specify position indices or east/west extremity
constraints for any node. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvSideBySideConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvSideBySideConstraint</a></span> is evaluated only if the corresponding nodes belong
to the same level. Typically you will use a same level constraint
to force the nodes to the same level, and then a side-by-side constraint
to force the nodes to a certain ordering. The side-by-side constraints
dominate the relative position constraints. If several side-by-side
constraints are conflicting, the one with the highest specified priority
dominates the other constraints. </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The  <span class="apilink"><a href="../../../../../../../../../../jviews-diagrammer87/doc/html/en-US/refjava/html/ilog/views/graphlayout/hierarchical/IlvRelativePositionConstraint.html" class="bluelink">IlvRelativePositionConstraint</a></span> is also evaluated only if the corresponding nodes
belong to the same level. It is dominated by the side-by-side constraint;
however, conflicts with side-by-side constraints are rare. If several
relative position constraints are conflicting, the one with the highest
specified priority dominates the other constraints.  </div>
