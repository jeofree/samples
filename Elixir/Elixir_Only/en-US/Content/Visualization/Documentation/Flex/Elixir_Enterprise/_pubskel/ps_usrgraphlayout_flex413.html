<h2 class="heading">Specifying east-west neighbors</h2>










<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">You can specify that two unrelated nodes must be direct
neighbors in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction. In the
level and radial layout modes, the nodes are placed in the same level
next to each other. In the free layout and tip-over modes, the nodes
are placed aligned at the north border. Such nodes are called <span class="italics">east-west neighbors</span> because one node
is placed as the direct neighbor on the east side of the other node.
The other node becomes the direct neighbor on the west side of the
first node. (See also <a href="ps_usrgraphlayout_flex384.html#usrgraphlayout.uss_graphlay_layouts.1198918" class="bluelink">Using compass directions for positional layout parameters
 (TL)</a>). </div>
<div class="para">Technically, the nodes are treated as parent and child,
even if there may be no link between them. Therefore, one of the two
nodes can have a real parent, but the other node should not because
its virtual parent is its <span class="italics">east-west
neighbor</span>.  </div>
<div class="para">The east-west neighbor feature can be used, for example,
for annotating nodes in a typed syntax tree occurring in compiler
construction. <a href="ps_usrgraphlayout_flex413.html#usrgraphlayout.uss_graphlay_layouts.1200012" class="bluelink">Annotated syntax tree of statement a[25] = b[24] +
0.5;</a> shows an
example of such a tree. </div>

<div class="para">To specify that two nodes are east-west neighbors, use
the method: </div>
<pre class="programlisting">
void setEastWestNeighboring(Object eastNode, Object westNode);   
</pre>
<div class="para">You can also use the following method, which is identical
except for the reversed parameter order: </div>
<pre class="programlisting">
void setWestEastNeighboring(Object westNode, Object eastNode);   
</pre>
<div class="para">If the flow direction is to the bottom, the latter method
may be easier to remember because, in this case, west is to the left
of east in the layout, which is similar to the text flow of the parameters. </div>
<div class="para">To obtain the node that is the east or west neighbor
of a node, use the calls: </div>
<pre class="programlisting">
Object getEastNeighbor(Object node);   
</pre>
<pre class="programlisting">
Object getWestNeighbor(Object node);   
</pre>
<div class="para">Note that each node can have at most one east neighbor
and one west neighbor because they are <span class="italics">direct</span> neighbors. If more than one direct neighbor
is specified, it is partially ignored. Cyclic specifications can cause
conflict as well. For instance, if node B is the east neighbor of
node A and node C is the east neighbor of B, then node A cannot be
the east neighbor of C. (Strictly speaking, such cycles could be technically
possible in some situations in the radial layout mode, but nonetheless
they are not allowed in any layout mode.) </div>
<div class="para">If B is the east neighbor of A, then A is automatically
the west neighbor of B. On the other hand, the east neighbor of A
can itself have another east neighbor. This allows the creation of
chains of east-west neighbors, which is a common way to visualize
lists of trees. Two examples are shown in <a href="ps_usrgraphlayout_flex413.html#usrgraphlayout.uss_graphlay_layouts.1200058" class="bluelink">Chains of east-west neighbors to visualize lists of

<h2 class="heading">Sequences of layouts with incremental changes</h2>

<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">You can work with trees that have become out-of-date,
for example, those that need to be extended with more child nodes.
If you perform a layout after an extension, you probably want to identify
the parts that had already been laid out in the original graph. The
Tree Layout algorithm supports these incremental changes in incremental
mode because it takes the previous positions of the nodes into account.
It preserves the relative order of the child nodes in the subsequent
layout. </div>
<div class="para">In nonincremental mode, the Tree Layout algorithm calculates
the order of the child nodes from the node order given by the attached
graph model (or grapher). In this case, the layout is independent
from the positions of the nodes before layout. It does not preserve
the relative order of the child nodes in subsequent layouts.</div>

<h2 class="heading">Interactive editing</h2>

<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The fact that the relative order of the layout is preserved
is particularly useful during interactive editing. It allows you to
correct the layout easily. For instance, if the first layout places
a node A left to its sibling node B but you need to reverse the order,
you can simply move node A to the right of node B and start a new
layout to clean up the drawing. In the second layout, A remains to
the right of B, and the subtree of A will “follow” node
A.  </div>
