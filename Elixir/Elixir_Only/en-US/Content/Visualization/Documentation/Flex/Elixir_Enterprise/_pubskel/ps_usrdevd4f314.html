</div><dl class="descriptionlist"><dt class="term">•	The nodeDataProvider property</dt><dd class="descriptionlistItem"><div class="para">The <span class="apiname">nodeDataProvider</span> property of the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> class represents
all the nodes of the graph, including subgraphs (that is, nodes containing
other nodes). This property is of type ICollectionView or IList. In
Flex, Collections or Lists are a very common and practical way to
iterate over, modify or listen to collections of objects.  There are
two main ways to specify data source depending on the type of the <span class="apiname">nodeDataProvider</span> property: flat or hierarchical.
If IList will be considered by the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> component as a flat list of nodes, the ICollectionView type also
allows hierarchically structured data to be passed through the use
of IHierarchicalCollectionView (which extends ICollectionView).</div>
<div class="para">  Where the nodeDataProvider  property is of type IList
or ICollectionView but not IHierarchicalCollectionView, the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> component will parse the collection and
render the nodes as a flat graph, without any notion of hierarchy.
All nodes will be added in the same parent container. </div>
<div class="para">Where the <span class="apiname">nodeDataProvider</span>  is of type IHierarchicalCollectionView, the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> component will render the graph in two different ways, depending
on its createLinksForHierarchy property value. This property controls
how the hierarchical relationship between nodes contained in the IHierarchicalCollectionView
should be interpreted when rendering the graph.</div>

</div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">If the createLinksForHierarchy property
of the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> class is true, the
graph is considered to be flat and the parent-child relationship between
source nodes will be represented by graphic Link instances connecting
Node instances. This can be useful if you want to display a tree-structured
data source without having to specify a linkDataProvider property
on the Diagram component (see next paragraph to learn more about this
linkDataProvider property). In brief, if createLinksForHierarchy property
of the Diagram class is true, both Node instance and Link instances
are created from the nodeDataProvider property of the Diagram component.
Link instances are inferred from the parent-child relationship existing
between nodes in the IHierarchicalCollectionView The linkDataProvider
property will not be taken into account, whatever its value.</div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">If the createLinksForHierarchy property
of the Diagram class is false, the parent-child relationship between
source nodes will be used to maintain a hierarchy between their graphic
representation in the diagram: data nodes that have child nodes will
be rendered as Subgraph instances (that contain the graphic representation
of their child objects) whereas nodes without child nodes will be
rendered as Node instances. Should child nodes then be added to one
of these nodes, its graphic representation would be replaced by a
Subgraph instance.  The simple application example shown above uses
this mode, which is the default mode of the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> component. In this configuration, links between nodes in the model
must be described in the <span class="apiname">linkDataProvider</span> property of the <span class="apiname">Diagram</span> component.</div>
</li></ul></div>
</dd><dt class="term">•	The linkDataProvider property</dt><dd class="descriptionlistItem"><div class="para">The linkDataProvider property of the
Diagram class explicitly defines links existing between nodes in the
graph. Its value is an IList of data link objects which will be rendered
as graphic Link instances depending on whether the nodes they are
connecting are rendered in the Diagram or not.  Since a link object
in the linkDataProvider property is supposed to connect two nodes
(that will be referred to as start node and end node hereafter) defined
in the nodeDataProvider property, the Diagram component needs to be
able to extract this information from the link data object. Two couple
of properties of the Diagram class are used for that purpose : startNodeField,
startNodeFunction and endNodeField, endNodeFunction.  startNodeField
is a String property holding the name of the property in link objects
containing the node from which that link starts. startNodeFunction
is a property of type Function that returns the node from which a
link starts. This property, if non null, takes precedence over the
startNodeField property. For instance, if a function was passed as
startNodeFunction, it will be used to extract the start node from
the link, even if the startNodeField property was set. If the startNodeFunction
property is null, the Diagram will use the startNodeField property
value to extract the start node from the link.  endNodeField and endNodeFunction
work exactly the same way, except that they concern the end node of
the link, that is the node the link goes towards.  For example, suppose
that our link in the data model exposes two properties ‘fromNode’
and ‘toNode’, respectively for start node and end node. </div>
<pre class="programlisting">// class representing a link in the data model
public class DataLink
{
    public var fromNode:Object;
    public var toNode:Object;

    // some other properties...
}
</pre>
<div class="para">Then we want to set the startNodeField and endNodeField
on the Diagram instance as follows :</div>
<pre class="programlisting">&lt;idiag:Diagram id="diagram"
               startNodeField="fromNode"
               endNodeField="endNode" /&gt;
</pre>
<div class="para">startNodeFunction and endNodeFunction properties provide
a way to extract start node and end node when they are not available
as simple properties in link objects for instance. Their common signature
is :  function startNodeFunction(diagram:Diagram,linkItem:Object):Object
function endNodeFunction(diagram:Diagram,linkItem:Object):Object 
where diagram is the main Diagram component rendering graph data (passed
as parameter for convenience), linkItem is the link object whose start
node or end node is to be determined, and the return value is the
start or end node object (depending on which function it is).  The
Diagram component will render and display graphic Links instances
for link objects in linkDataProvider only if both start node and end
node are in the nodeDataProvider  collection view. This means that
if one of these nodes is not available when parsing the nodeDataProvider
(due to a filter of some kind installed on the collection view, or
closed nodes on a IHierarchicalCollectionView), the link will not
be added to the diagram. Consistently, its graphic renderer will be
removed from the Diagram (if previously added) should one of its ends
nodes be filtered out from the nodeDataProvider. However, ‘pending
links’, that is data links whose ends are not yet added to
the Diagram, of were removed, will be registered by the Diagram as
so. When both end data nodes of a pending link are rendered and added
to the Diagram, the link itself will be renderer and added to the
Diagram component as well. There is no need to ensure that start and
end nodes of a data link are added prior the link itself. The Diagram
component takes care of maintaining the consistence. </div>
