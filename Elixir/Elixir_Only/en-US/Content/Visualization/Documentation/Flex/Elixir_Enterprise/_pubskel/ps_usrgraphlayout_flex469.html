<div class="para">Depending on the support of its sublayouts, Recursive

<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The Recursive Layout can stop the entire layout of a
nested graph after a certain amount of time. If the allowed time setting
has elapsed, the Recursive Layout stops; that means it stops the currently
running layout of a subgraph and skips the subsequent layouts of subgraphs
that have not yet been started. If at the stop time point a sublayout
is running on a subgraph that does not support the “allowed
time” feature, then this sublayout first runs to completion
before the Recursive Layout is stopped. If the Recursive Layout stops
early because the allowed time has elapsed, the result code in the
layout report is <code class="code">IlvGraphLayoutReport.STOPPED_AND_INVALID</code>.  </div>

<h2 class="heading">Percentage completion calculation</h2>


<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The Recursive Layout calculates the percentage of completion.
This value can be obtained from the layout report during the run of
the layout. The value is, however, a very rough estimation. If the
layouts on the subgraphs do not support the calculation of the percentage
completion, the Recursive Layout can report the percentage based only
on the information how many layouts of subgraphs are already finished.
For instance, if the entire nesting structure contains five nested
graphs, the mechanism reports 20% after the layout of the first subgraph
has finished, 40% after the layout of the second subgraph has finished,
and so on. If the layouts of the subgraphs support the calculation
of the percentage completion, the Recursive Layout calculates a more
detailed percentage. In most cases, the calculated percentage is only
a very rough estimation that does not always grow linearly over time.
