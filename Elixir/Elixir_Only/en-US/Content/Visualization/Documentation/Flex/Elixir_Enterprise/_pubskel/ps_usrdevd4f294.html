<h2 class="heading">Using the Diagram component</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The Diagram component is a data-driven component able
to display diagrams composed of nodes and links. In <span class="classificationVariable">Diagram</span>, a diagram is an instance of the
Diagram class that is able to display nodes and links, creating their
graphical representation based on business data. Nodes are specified
via the nodeDataProvider property, whereas links are specified via
the linkDataProvider property. Using Diagram, objects can be laid
out using graph layout algorithms or can have their position specified
according to properties in the business data objects. Diagrams also
provide support for the select, move, zoom, pan, and scroll operations
as well as for customized interactions such as editing and drill-down.</div>

<h2 class="heading">Using the Graph components </h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The <span class="classificationVariable">Diagram</span> product also allows you to create
your own logic to manipulate the graphic objects that represent entities
and relationships in your diagram. Instead of using the Diagram component,
you can use the graphic objects directly, such as Graph, Node, Link
and Subgraph.   While Diagram focuses on displaying nodes and links
based on information that is present in data providers, the Graph
component shows the relationships between entities at a pure graphic
level. A Graph is a group that contains and lays out nodes and links.
A subgraph is a special kind of node that is able itself to display
nodes and links, and which can be represented, collapsed, or expanded.
Subgraphs allow the representation of hierarchical data.</div>

<h2 class="heading">Using Graph Layout algorithms</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">Graph layout algorithms can be used directly by the Graph
and Diagram components. However, you can also use the existing Graph
Layout algorithms when you are displaying objects in your own custom
component. The Graph Layout algorithms provide specific methods that
are used only when they are performed in a component that is neither
a Diagram nor a Graph.  In order to perform a graph layout algorithm
on your own graphic objects, you need to implement a graph layout
model that matches your needs. The graph layout model must be a concrete
implementation of the IGraphLayoutModel interface. When the graph
layout model is implemented, then you can attach the graph layout
model to the layout algorithm and perform the layout when needed.

algorithms documentation].  </div>
