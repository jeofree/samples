<div class="descriptiveTopicContent">
<div class="para">In some circumstances you may need to use a sequence
of layouts on the same graph. For example: </div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">You work with graphs that have become
out-of-date and you need to extend the graph. If you perform a layout
on the extended graph, you probably want to identify the parts that
were already laid out in the original graph. The layout should not
change very much when compared with the layout of the original graph. </div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">The first layout results in a drawing
with minor deficiencies. You want to solve these deficiencies manually
and perform a second layout to clean up the drawing. The second layout
probably should not greatly change the parts of the graph that were
already acceptable after the first layout.  </div>
</li></ul></div>
<div class="para">The Hierarchical Layout normally works nonincrementally.
It performs a layout from scratch and moves all nodes to new positions
and reroutes all links. The previous positions of nodes have no influence
on the result of the layout. Hence, even a small change can cause
a large effect on the next layout. </div>
<div class="para">But the Hierarchical Layout also supports incremental
sequences of layout that “do not change very much.”
It can place the nodes close to their previous positions, so that
you can more easily identify the parts that had already been laid
out in the original graph. Incremental mode takes the previous positions
of the nodes into account. In this mode the algorithm preserves the
relative order of the levels and the nodes within the levels in the
subsequent layout. It does not preserve the absolute positions of
the nodes, but it tries to detect the structure of the previous layout
by examining the node coordinates. For instance, if two nodes are
in the same level, then they stay in the same level after an incremental
layout. If a node is in a higher level than another node, it stays
in the higher level.  </div>

an incremental and nonincremental layout. </div>

<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">The layout algorithm analyzes the drawing in incremental
mode in the following way: </div>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="orderedlistItem"><div class="para">First, it determines from the node coordinates
which nodes must belong to the same level. For instance, if the flow
direction is towards the bottom, it tries to detect horizontal reference
lines at those vertical positions where many nodes are placed along
a line. The specified vertical node offset helps to detect these lines
because the horizontal reference lines should be approximately the
vertical node offset apart. See the following figure. </div>
</li><li class="orderedlistItem"><div class="para">All nodes that touch the same reference
line are assigned to the same level. </div></li><li class="orderedlistItem"><div class="para">It determines the order of the nodes
within each level by analyzing where the node touches the reference
line. For instance, if the flow direction is towards the bottom, it
determines from the x coordinate of the nodes how they are ordered
within the levels. </div></li><li class="orderedlistItem"><div class="para">If long links span several levels, the
algorithm can preserve the shape of a long link. It determines the
point where a link crosses the level reference line. It creates a
bend point for the long link inside the level. It tries to preserve
the order of the bend points in each level. For instance, if in a
flow direction towards the bottom, a long link bypasses another node
on the right side, then the incremental layout tries to find a similar
shape of the link that bypasses the node on the right side, as illustrated
in the following figure. </div></li><li class="orderedlistItem"><div class="para">Finally, the layout tries to calculate
the absolute positions of the nodes that respect the levels and the
ordering within the levels. It tries to balance the node positions.
However, it also tries to place each node close to its previous position.
Both criteria often compete with each other, because to get a perfect
balance, nodes must sometimes move far from their original position.
The Hierarchical Layout contains a parametrized heuristic to satisfy
both criteria. </div></li></ol></div>

between long links are not resolved. If crossings of long links are
not desired, it may be better to reroute long links from scratch.

<div class="para">This statement specifies that within the range of 100
coordinate units from the old position of the node, the balance is
the only criteria for the placement. This means that a node whose
optimal position is less than 100 coordinate units away from its previous
position is placed exactly at its optimal position. Nodes whose optimal
position is farther away are placed at a position that is a compromise
between previous position and optimal position. This is illustrated
in figure below, right. </div>

</div>
<div class="para">This statement specifies that when the optimal position
of a node is far away from its previous position, its position is
70% influenced by its previous position and 30% influenced by its
optimal position. Imagine a rubber band that tries to pull a node
to its previous position, and another rubber band that tries to pull
the same node to its optimally balanced position. The level position
tendency <code class="code">70</code> means that one rubber band
pulls with 70% of the force towards the previous position, and the
other rubber band pulls with 30% towards the optimal position. Increasing
the tendency means that the node stays closer to its old position,
decreasing it means that the node moves closer to its optimal position.
If you set the tendency to 0%, this has the same effect as disabling
the incremental absolute level positioning (see the following figure). </div>

<h3 class="heading">Marking nodes for incremental layout</h3>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">Incremental layout normally treats all nodes and links
of the drawing in the same way. However, you may have added nodes
and links to the drawing programmatically, and the new nodes and links
do not have meaningful coordinates yet. Perhaps you have placed them
all at the origin (0,0), or at random coordinates. In this case, you
need an incremental layout that takes the coordinates of all nodes
into account that were previously laid out, while it ignores the coordinates
of all new nodes. The incremental mode of the Hierarchical Layout
allows you to specify in Java which nodes cannot be laid out incrementally
by calling the method: </div>
<pre class="programlisting">
layout.markForIncremental(nodeOrLink);
</pre>
<div class="para">If you call this statement, the node or link is marked
such that its coordinates are ignored during the next incremental
layout. The positions of marked nodes and links are calculated from
scratch. The mark is valid only until the next layout and is automatically
cleared afterwards. </div>
