<div class="para">You can use swim lanes if the nodes are partitioned into
groups, to indicate which nodes belong to a certain group. The nodes
in the same swim lane are placed so that it is possible to draw a
surrounding rectangle around them. Swim lanes allow you to organize
the graph in a table-like manner. For example, you may have a workflow
diagram where nodes represent actions; the swim lanes could then represent
the departments that perform these actions. Each node can belong to
only one swim lane.</div>

<div class="para">The relative size indicates how large this swim lane
is compared to the other swim lanes. Assume that the flow direction
is towards the bottom. In this case, the relative size indicates the
width of the swim lane. All swim lanes with the same relative size
will have the same width. A swim lane with a relative size that is
twice the value of another swim lane will have twice the width of
the other swim lane. The actual number of this parameter does not
matter, only how large the value is compared to the other swim lanes.
If you do not want to restrict the size of the swim lane, set the
value to 0. In this case, the width of the swim lane will be independent
of the other swim lanes. </div>
<div class="para">The minimum margin is the margin of the swim lane in
absolute coordinates. If the flow direction is towards the bottom,
then the west minimum margin is the minimum horizontal distance between
the leftmost node of the swimlane and the left swim lane border, and
the east minimum margin is the minimum horizontal distance between
the rightmost node of the swimlane and the right swim lane border.</div>
<div class="para">The position index indicates the order of the swim lanes.
Just as nodes have position indices, the swim lanes are placed sequentially
at relative positions numbered from 0 to n. In a top-down layout,
the swim lane with position 0 is the leftmost swim lane, and the swim
lanes with higher position indices are placed farther to the right.
If the swim lanes have the position index -1, the layout algorithm
determines the appropriate position automatically. </div>
<div class="para">A swim lane constraint is always evaluated, even if the
incremental mode is enabled. The constraint has a higher priority
than the relative position constraint and the side-by-side constraint.
You can specify side-by-side constraints for a group of nodes that
belong to the same swim lane, but side-by-side constraints of nodes
of different swim lanes are ignored. You can specify relative position
constraints between nodes of the same swim lane. You can also specify
relative position constraints between one entire swim lane group and
another swim lane group, which effectively orders the swim lanes.
But relative position constraints are ignored if they would require
breaking the swim lanes apart. The swim lane constraint dominates
the specified position indices and the extremity constraints, that
is, if a swim lane constraint is used, you cannot specify position
indices or east/west extremity constraints for any node. </div>

<div class="para">The automatic conflict resolution can handle conflicting
constraints. However, to speed up the layout, it is recommended that
you specify constraints in such a way that there are no conflicts.
