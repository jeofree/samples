<div class="descriptiveTopicContent">
<div class="para">D4F provides many built-in layout algorithms that allow
you to lay out graphs made up of nodes and links automatically. The <span class="apiname">GraphLayout</span> class is the base class for layout.
You will find classes to create tree or hierarchical representations
automatically. To learn about graph layout algorithms see Graph Layout
Algorithms.</div>

<div class="para">In some situations, diagrams can be drawn manually and
still kept clear to read. The user typically places the nodes and
links and repositions the nodes manually if the diagram becomes cluttered.</div>
<div class="para">In many cases, the diagram is too complex to be handled
manually, or there is no human being involved: the diagram is built
dynamically with application data that does not contain any geometric
information. In such cases, automatic layout algorithms are required
to position the nodes and to route the links.</div>
<div class="para">The Graph Layout package is a set of layout algorithms
provided with D4F to position nodes and route links automatically.
The goal of a layout algorithm is to propose solutions in which nodes
do not overlap and links do not cross nodes or links. Ideal solutions
do not always exist, but an algorithm will tend to an optimal one,
see the following figure.</div>

<div class="para">The most effective way of displaying a graph depends
on its type and sometimes on industry standards. D4F offers various
algorithms with many parameters to adapt to the many situations. For
example, the hierarchical layout is mainly used for displaying flows
and processes; radial tree layout for semantic networks and website
maps; and tree layout for organization charts, decision trees, and
directories.</div>
<div class="para">In D4F, several graph layouts can be applied to a single
diagram: a subgraph may require a different layout from its parent;
or one layout can be applied to only a subset of the nodes. Constraints
can also be set, for example, to make nodes with a certain property
stay above the others.</div>
<div class="para">When it comes to routing links, D4F offers the following:
strategies to limit the length of links, and algorithms to bundle
links or connect nicely to nodes, especially when several links arrive
at a single node.</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="heading">User interactions</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">When you have populated your diagram, you still need
to provide the user with a means of interacting with the diagram.</div>
<div class="para">Modeling applications require interactions for creating
nodes of many sorts, for creating links with various shapes, for setting
user-defined properties, for selecting nodes and links, for moving
nodes around, for editing subgraphs, and for other similar purposes.</div>
<div class="para">D4F offers a wide range of editing capabilities implemented
by the <span class="apiname">DiagramEditor</span> class, which
allows the most common editing actions.</div>
<div class="itemizedlist"><div class="itemizedlistIntro">
<div class="para">The predefined interactions provided by the <span class="apiname">DiagramEditor</span> include: </div>
</div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Drop (from a palette)</div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Select (single or multiple)</div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Move </div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Resize</div></li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Reparent to/from a different SubGraph</div>

</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">Link reconnection</div>
</li><li class="itemizedlistItem"><div class="para">In-place text editing </div>
</li></ul></div>
<div class="para">Monitoring applications often require a subset of the
interactions proposed in modeling applications. The most common ones
are zoom, pan, and select. In monitoring applications, selection is
often specific to the application: when the user selects a node or
a link, D4F performs a specific action like opening a dialog box or
selecting all the alarms generated by the selected object. To implement
application-specific interactions, you will have to listen for the
diagram events and perform the application-specific task using a listener
function.</div>

<h2 class="heading">Backgrounds and maps</h2>
<div class="sectionContent">
<div class="para">If your application requires a map as a background, you
can add a vector or a bitmap background. The background is added to
the diagram as part of its skin. See the following figure for details.</div>
