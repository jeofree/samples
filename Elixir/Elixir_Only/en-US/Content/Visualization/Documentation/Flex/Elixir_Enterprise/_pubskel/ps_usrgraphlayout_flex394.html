<div class="para">The spacing of the layout is controlled mainly by three
spacing parameters: the distance between a parent and its child nodes,
the minimum distance between siblings, and the minimum distance between
nodes of different branches. For instance, if the flow direction is
to the top or bottom, the offset between parent and child nodes is
vertical, while the sibling offset and the branch offset are horizontal. </div>
<div class="para">For tip-over alignment, an additional spacing parameter
is provided: the minimum distance between branches starting at a node
with tip-over alignment. This offset is always orthogonal to the normal
branch offset. If the flow direction is to the top or bottom, the
tip-over branch offset is vertical. </div>

<div class="sectionContent">

<div class="para">The spacing parameters normally specify the minimum offsets
between the node borders. Hence, the layout algorithm places the nodes
such that they do not overlap. You can also specify that the layout
should ignore the node sizes.</div>

<div class="para">In this case, the spacing parameters are interpreted
as the minimum distances between the node centers, and the node sides
are not taken into account during the layout. However, if the specified
offset parameters are now smaller than the node size, the nodes and
links will overlap. This often happens with orthogonal links in particular.
It makes sense to use this option only if all nodes have approximately
the same size, all links are straight, and the spacing parameters
are larger than the largest node. </div>
<div class="para">If the link style is orthogonal, the shape of the links
from the parent to its child nodes looks like a fork (see <a href="ps_usrgraphlayout_flex389.html#usrgraphlayout.uss_graphlay_layouts.1199121" class="bluelink">Different alignments mixed in the same drawing</a>). The position
of the bend points in this shape can be influenced by the <span class="italics">orthogonal fork percentage</span>, a value
between <code class="code">0</code> and <code class="code">100</code>. This is a percentage of the parent child offset. If the orthogonal
fork percentage is <code class="code">0</code>, the link shape forks
directly at the parent node. If the percentage is <code class="code">100</code>, the link shape forks at the child node. A good choice is between <code class="code">25</code> and <code class="code">75</code>. This percentage
can be set. </div>

<div class="para">If the link style is not orthogonal, links may overlap
neighboring nodes. This happens only in a very few cases, for instance,
when a link starts at a very small node that is neighbored by a very
large node. This deficiency can be fixed by increasing the branch
offset. However, this influences the layout globally, affecting nodes
without that deficiency. To avoid a global change, you can change
the <span class="italics">overlap percentage</span> instead, which is a value between 0 and 100. This value is used
by an internal heuristic of the layout algorithm that considers a
node to be smaller by this percentage. The default percentage is <code class="code">30</code>. This usually results in better usage of the space.
However, if very small nodes are neighbored to very large nodes, it
is recommended to decrease the overlap percentage or to set it to <code class="code">0</code> to switch this heuristic off to avoid links overlapping
nodes. </div>
